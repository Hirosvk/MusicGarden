    <h1>How to Play SoundCanvas</h1>
    <h2>Play Demo</h2>
      <p>
        The best way to get to know SoundCanvas is to watch demo tracks first. Choose a demo track and click "Play this Demo." You can play over the demo.
      </p>
    <h2>Create Music</h2>
      <p>
        Click 'Start' and the back beat will begin. Play any notes by typing keys or by clicking the note buttons. Shapes will emerge on the canvas. Click "Stop" to stop the beat.
      </p>
    <h2>Change Settings</h2>
      <p>
        You can change Tempo, Scales, and Beat Pattern.
      </p>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>
      <p>
        SoundCanvas creates animation from your music based on some rules, and it does not rely on randomization. The intevals of the notes you play determine colors.
